## Introduction

Orion Proxy is a high performance and memory safe implementation of popular [Envoy Proxy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/). Orion Proxy is implemented in Rust using high-quality open source components. 

### Key features

**Memory Safety**

Rust programming language allows to avoid a whole lot of bugs related to memory management and data races making Orion Proxy a very robust and secure application.  


**Performance**

Orion Proxy offers 2x-4x better throughput and latency than Envoy Proxy. Refer to [Performance](docs/performance/performance.md) to see performance figures and for more details how we tested Orion Proxy .  


**Compatibility**

Orion Proxy configuration is generated from Envoy's xDS protobuf definitions. Orion Proxy aims to be a drop in replacement for Envoy.



## Quick Start

### Building
```console
git clone https://github.com/kmesh-net/orion
cd orion
git submodule init
git submodule update --force
cargo build
```

### Running
```console
cargo run --bin orion -- --config orion/conf/orion-runtime.yaml
```

### Docker

Build and run with Docker:

```bash
# Build
docker build -t orion-proxy -f docker/Dockerfile .

# Run (development mode - see logs)
docker run -p 8000:8000 --name orion-proxy orion-proxy

# Verify service
curl -v http://localhost:8000/direct-response # Should return HTTP 200 with "meow! üê±"

# Alternative for production (detached mode)
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name orion-proxy orion-proxy

# View logs of running container
docker logs orion-proxy
```

For detailed Docker configuration options, see [docker/README.md](docker/README.md).
